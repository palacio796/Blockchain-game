Our Coin Flip Game project leverages distributed systems to create a decentralized and transparent betting platform. Utilizing the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, the game allows users to place bets on the outcome of a coin flip directly from their Metamask wallets.

Rules of the game:
User sends ETH to the address displayed on website. This will update your balance. Once you have funds you may place a bet on either Heads or Tails. Once coin is flipped, a correct bet will grant you with 2x your bet but an uncorrect bet will take what you bet.
